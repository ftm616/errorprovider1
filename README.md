The ErrorProvider component in C# WinForms is used to display user-friendly error messages next to controls such as TextBoxes, ComboBoxes, and other input fields. It shows a small red icon beside the control, and when the user hovers over the icon, a tooltip appears with the error message.

This is commonly used for input validation, for example when a textbox is empty, contains invalid characters, or does not meet specific conditions.
